#+title:  FROGMOSS
sick afro. button up blue shirt and pants. frog humanoid.
Quiet other than the occassional croak.
The others seem to protect him.
He heals a few of our wounds with magic.
And one spell in particular he cast using a sonourous tone froma croak that resonateed deeply in Ulot's souls.
Frogmoss is paints.
